# MovingShadowDetection
It aims for moving shadow detection under the surveillance. 
The code is implemented by C++. 

The dataset can be obtained from:   https://pan.baidu.com/s/18zF6h2BMnW6XmkpJEHX_wQ     Extraction code:  k6yz.

Actually, the dataset is originally from http://arma.sourceforge.net/shadows/.       
Thanks for the previous work from  A. Sanin  et al.
